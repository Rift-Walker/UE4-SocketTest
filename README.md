# UE4-SocketTest
A simple test of the UE4 Socket Subsystem

Connects N clients together via UDP.
Advertises clients' udp ports and ip addresses via Unreal Networking. Supports late join but not splitscreen (yet).
To test, run in editor with dedicated server and 2 or more clients, and watch the logs.
